# Color-Quantization-and-Compression
Implemented color quantization for 24-bit BMP images in Java using RGB bucketing and k-means clustering (Euclidean and hue-based). Reduced color diversity while preserving quality. Gained experience in image compression, file formats, and unsupervised learning for computer vision tasks.
