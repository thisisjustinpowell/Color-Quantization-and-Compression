# Color-Quantization-and-Compression
Project for my Data Structures and Algorithms II class, taught by Dr. Nicholas Farnan at the University of Pittsburgh.
Implemented color quantization for 24-bit BMP images in Java using RGB bucketing and k-means clustering (Euclidean and hue-based). Reduced color diversity while preserving quality. Gained experience in image compression, file formats, and unsupervised learning for computer vision tasks.
